# centris-WEB-scraper
selenium web scraper

I built this project to automate the process of web scraping Centris to see if there are any multiplex properties for sale that have positive cash flow. This selenium based web scraper will auto login to my centris account and then print out the cash flows.

In one running of the script, I can tell if any duplex of the triplex is worth looking into if it has the possative monthly cash flow or not. 


New project, login, if the price is covered by a potential revenue click heart then go next page.
