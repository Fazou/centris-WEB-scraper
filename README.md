# centris-WEB-scraper
selenium webscrape

I built this project to automate the process of webscraping Centris to see if there are any multiplex properties 
for sale that have possative cash flow. This selenium based webscraper will auto login to my centris account and then print out the cashflows.

In one running of the script i can tell if any duplex of triplex is worth looking into if it has possative monthly cashflow or not.
